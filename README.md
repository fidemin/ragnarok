# Ragnarok

A simple and understandable deep learning framework built from scratch.

Ragnarok is a lightweight educational deep learning framework designed to help you understand the inner workings of neural networks — from variable(tensor) operations and automatic differentiation to layers, optimisers, and training loops.


## Motivation
Most modern frameworks (like PyTorch or TensorFlow) abstract away the fundamentals. **Ragnarok** is built to **demystify** how deep learning actually works under the hood — providing readable, minimal code without black-box magic.


## Features
- **Pure Python implementation with numpy** — minimal dependencies
- **Variable(Tensor) class** with basic operations and gradients  
- **Automatic differentiation engine** (autograd)
- **Layers and activations** built from first principles
- **Optimisers** (SGD, Adam, etc.)
- **Training loop utilities**
- **Readable, modular codebase** for learning and extension
